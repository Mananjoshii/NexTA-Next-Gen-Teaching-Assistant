I'd be happy to help you with your web development course.

So, you're wondering when and where we first learn about creating our first HTML website?

We actually cover this topic in Video 2 of our course. If you check the video title and number at the beginning of that video, it's called "Your First HTML Website" (Video #2).

If I recall correctly, this is where we dive into creating our very own first web page using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. We'll go through the process step-by-step, from setting up a basic project to designing and building our website.

To find Video 2, simply click on the "Next" button or scroll down until you reach it in your video list. You can also check the timestamps at the beginning of each video to ensure you're watching the correct one.

Let me know if you have any other questions or need further guidance!
